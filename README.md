# TNET - HCI CORE

HCI CORE, is a custom hardware project built from the ESP32 MCU. Designed to expose various sensors and HCI devices over Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), this firmware aims to maximise power efficiency using programming techniques and RTOS constructs.

## Bluetooth Low Energy

BLE Services follow SIG-assigned numbers, maximising compatibility with other applications, including Strava.

## Design Overview

The image below illustrates the current system design and BLE functionality.
