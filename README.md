# TNET - HCI - CORE

C++ firmware designed to interface hardware devices over Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).

The firmware demonstrates the use of standard C++ programming conventions, object-oriented design and RTOS constructs to provide efficient and maintainable code.

BLE Services follow SIG-assigned numbers, maximising compatibility with other applications, including Strava.

## Design Overview

The image below illustrates the current system design and BLE functionality.
